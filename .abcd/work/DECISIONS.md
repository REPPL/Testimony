# DECISIONS

Append-only, one line per decision, newest last. Date-prefixed.
Architecture-shaping decisions graduate to an ADR under
[`../development/decisions/adrs/`](../development/decisions/adrs/).

- 2026-07-17 — Adopt the three-tier working-state layout (`.abcd/development/`
  durable, `.abcd/work/` shared, `.abcd/.work.local/` local-only) and the
  working conventions recorded in `AGENTS.md`.
- 2026-07-17 — Pin the commit identity (`.abcd/config/identity.json`) to the
  repository's GitHub noreply identity; repo-local git config matches it.
- 2026-07-17 — `transcribe` engine order: WhisperX preferred (word-level
  timestamps), whisper.cpp fallback; both invoked as subprocesses whose JSON
  output is the contract, never their human-readable stdout.
- 2026-07-17 — Audio→session offset defaults to ffprobe `creation_time` minus
  manifest `t0_epoch_ms` (best-effort, never fatal); the `-offset` flag
  overrides.
- 2026-07-17 — Architecture §11 aligned to code: `manifest.json` and
  `events.rrweb.jsonl` + `interactions.jsonl` (divergence flagged in PR #2).
- 2026-07-17 — WhisperX VAD defaults to silero (`-vad` overrides): pyannote's
  checkpoint trips newer torch's `weights_only` load and aborts every run;
  found in the first live end-to-end session on the target Mac.
